# 📘 Programming Foundations: Fundamentals – Summary

## 🧠 Core Concepts
Programming is the process of writing instructions (code) for a computer to execute.  
A program is a set of instructions that solves a problem.  
A **bug** is an error in the code. A **crash** happens when the program stops unexpectedly.

---

## 🔤 Syntax vs Semantics
- **Syntax**: The rules for writing valid code (grammar of the language).  
- **Semantics**: The meaning behind the code (what it does).

---

## 🧪 Variables and Data Types
A **variable** is a named storage for data.

Example:  
- `x = 5` (Python)  
- `let x = 5` (JavaScript)

**Common data types:**
- `int` – whole number  
- `float` – decimal number  
- `string` – text  
- `bool` – true / false

---

## ➕ Operators
**Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`  
**Relational**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`  

**Logical**  
- Python: `and`, `or`, `not`  
- JavaScript: `&&`, `||`, `!`

---

## 🔁 Control Flow
Used to make decisions and repeat actions.

### If / Else
```python
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
else:
    print("Not positive")
Loops
python
Copy
Edit
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

x = 0
while x < 10:
    x += 1
    print(x)
🔧 Functions
Python
python
Copy
Edit
def greet(name):
    return "Hello " + name
JavaScript
javascript
Copy
Edit
function greet(name) {
    return "Hello " + name;
}
🛠️ Errors
Syntax error: Code cannot run (e.g., missing colon)

Logic error: Code runs, but result is wrong (e.g., wrong formula)

⚙️ Compilation vs Interpretation
Compiled languages (e.g., C#, Java):

Code is translated into machine code before running.

Interpreted languages (e.g., Python, JavaScript):

Code is executed line by line.

🧱 IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
Tools to help write and manage code.
Examples:

Visual Studio

Visual Studio Code

PyCharm

Repl.it

💡 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Basics
Class: A blueprint for creating objects.

Object: An instance of a class.

Encapsulation: Bundling data and methods.

Inheritance: Child class inherits from parent.

Polymorphism: One function behaves differently based on context.

Abstraction: Hiding internal details, showing only the essentials.
