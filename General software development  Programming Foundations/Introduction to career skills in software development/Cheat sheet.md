 1 Life as a Programmer


Computer programmers design, develop and test software.
Software encompases the programs and operating instructions used by any computing device
Laptop, phone, plane , car all use software.
Programers ensure that software to best practice in performance, reliability and security of software.
Programers make software based on needs. 
-What software should be developed
-Design
-Develop
-Test
-Write code 

Maintain the health of software.

Activities 
Monday:
-prepare for the week ahead
-meet the teams to discuss priorities

Tuesday:
-research
-write new code 

Wednesday:
-debug issues

Debugging -the process od finding and removing errors or bugs in your code 

Thursday:
-run code 
-debug
-write test


Software tests are written using code.The verify that what you developed behaves correctly.It is one way programmes check their work.

Friday:
-show your work to the rest of the team
-debug
-new ideas



Top 3 challenges in programmers careers 

Challenge 1 - Naming - ,each class,file and variable can have a name 
Naming things properly will make the easy to read and understand.

Challenge 2 - Working with the legacy code 
Legacy code - code that you afraid to change, code is not up todate to sofwate practices and design
Code is too compicated to understand,there are no test, or tests are insufficient


Challenge 3 - Providing estimates 
The work is complex with more variables.


Technology is constantly upgraded and evolving
You are responsible for your career, subscribe, follow trends and industries,subscribe to podcast
Working on a side project to explore a new technology in your free time
Tech community conferences, webinars,local events 

Programming is solving problems with technology
So if you keep your mind sharp and continue to think critically you be just fine.


 Software development

Software development involves various processes related to software design, development and delivery.
Software is set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do
There are 3 basic types 
System software  - provide core functions such as operating systems or hardware management
Application software - helps users perform a specific task
Programming software - gives programmers the tools they need to create code 

Software is written in thousand of languages, some is paid some is free


Software development life cycle (SDLC)
There are 7 fazes in SDLC 
-Requirements gathering 
-Analysis
-Design
-Coding
-Testing
-Deployment
-Maintenance


Development team
-Business stakeholder
-Product manager (pm)
-User experience designers
-User interface designers
-Programmers (front end, back end, full-stack)
-Quality assurance engineer


Tools used for software development
-whiteboards  - for ideas 
-online collaborations software
-project management software 
-integrated development enviroments (IDE) use programmers 
-paper and pencil


Software deployment 
delivering software to the intended users



Tools of the trade 
Programmers use version control system to make updates to their code safely
Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code 
Version control system (VCS) - tools that helps software teams manage code changes
VCS benefits 
-history of changes 
-simultaneous work
-troubleshooting

Most popular is GIT 

Repository hosting services
Third party web applications  that wrap and enhance a version control system
GIT &  GITHub store your work in a cloud system , software package registry,
github has a code review built in, github workflows.

Bitbucket - code review , but with jira you can create tasks and issues directly in code review
Bitbucket also has pipelines and security 


Library is code that someone else has written and verified 
Libraries are essential for modern software development because otherwise we would solve the same fundamental
problems repeatedly. Each library serves a particular purpose. 

Framework is more than a simple tools it serves as the blueprint for how your software project should be configured and developed 


IDE - integrated development environment 
is an application that provides special tools for programmers to write, debug, and compile code 
IDE's help programmers be more productive with their daily coding tasks

VS code , Intelij IDEA (Java), Sublime Text (less robust)
IDE can ease thew burden of software development by providing tools to help you write, debug and compile code 


Three resourse to get unstock
-official documendation 
-stackoverlow
-community

Go for a short walk to clear your head 



Programming languages 
There are thousand programming languages available
Programming language is a way of providing instructions to a computer written in text and based on a set of rules 
Computers only understand machine language , it is higly complex language, it is a long series of numbers.
We use other programming languages that are closer to human language.

Programming language can be broken into two main components
Syntax or rules,  and Semantics or meaning

Programming languages have unique syntax rules 

Source code is human readable computer instructions written by programmers 
Source code is created in multiple lines of code it can contain empty lines and spaces

Compile is one way that human readable code is converted to machine code 
In programming we use variables as a container for a value
When we run our programs computers gives us a space in computer memory where we can put data that we want to use as  a reference for later.This is called a variable.

Constants are special variables whose values don't change 

Statement are individual action that you want your program to take
Each statement can be made up of keywords, operators and expressions. 
Operators are symbols that tell the computer to perform an action with some input (+-*/)
Expressions are operations that break down into a single value
Keyword a reserved word that means something special to the given programming language
Each programming language has a set of reserved keywords useful for building robust statements
Computer programs are made of statements 

Top 5 programming language  - at the time of recording
java
python
javascript
c++
c#

Python is easy, consise 
it was designed to be a general purpose language, web aplication, games, scientific analises and more 
it is an excelent choise to explore 

print("Hello worrdl")

score = 750 

print(score)


Conditional or boolean expression is expression that breaks down to true or false 

DRY - dont repeat yourself

Function is a block of code grouped together with a name, they are core feature of all programming languages

create function in python
def say_hello(name):
   print(f"Hello, {name}")

a pozivanje funkcije    

say_hello("Tiffany")

i sad ce da prikaze Hello Tiffany


OOP object oriented programming - using code to represent real world things and situations
Class is a blueprint how should other objects are created 
Cookie cutter - class and instances 

class in python

class Puppy():
    def __init__(self, name, favorite_toy):
         self.name= name
         self.favouritte_toy = favourite_toy

    def play(self):
        print(self.name + " is playing with the " + self.favourite_toy)


marble = Puppy('Marble','teddy bear')
marbe.play() 


Module is a file consisting of Python code. It can define functions , classes, variables, and more

Advantages to breaking up code 
Simplicity, 
Maintainability,
Reusability,


import is like using in C# - it is adding a module (library) to our program


Depending on your programming language variables can behave differently

Naming variables to use short descriptive names
