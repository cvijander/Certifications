# Life as a Programmer

Computer programmers design, develop, and test software. Software encompasses the programs and operating instructions used by any computing device, including laptops, phones, planes, and cars. Programmers ensure best practices in performance, reliability, and security of software.

### Responsibilities:
- Identify what software should be developed
- Design
- Develop
- Test
- Write code
- Maintain software health

### Weekly Activities:
**Monday:**
- Prepare for the week ahead
- Meet with teams to discuss priorities

**Tuesday:**
- Research
- Write new code

**Wednesday:**
- Debug issues

**Thursday:**
- Run code
- Debug
- Write tests

**Friday:**
- Show work to the team
- Debug
- Generate new ideas

### Debugging:
The process of finding and removing errors (bugs) in code.

### Software Tests:
Software tests are written using code to verify that the developed software behaves correctly.

## Top 3 Challenges in a Programmer's Career:
### Challenge 1: Naming
Each class, file, and variable needs a meaningful name for better readability and understanding.

### Challenge 2: Working with Legacy Code
Legacy code refers to outdated software that is difficult to change due to poor documentation, lack of tests, or overly complex design.

### Challenge 3: Providing Estimates
Software projects are complex with many variables, making accurate time estimation difficult.

## Career Development:
- Stay updated with technology trends
- Subscribe to relevant podcasts and industry newsletters
- Work on side projects to explore new technologies
- Participate in tech community events, conferences, and webinars

### Programming is problem-solving with technologyâ€”keep your mind sharp and think critically.

# Software Development

Software development involves processes related to software design, development, and delivery. Software consists of a set of instructions or programs that tell a computer what to do.

### Three Basic Types of Software:
1. **System Software** â€“ Provides core functions such as operating systems or hardware management.
2. **Application Software** â€“ Helps users perform specific tasks.
3. **Programming Software** â€“ Provides tools needed for coding.

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
1. Requirements Gathering
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Coding
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

### Development Team Roles:
- Business Stakeholder
- Product Manager (PM)
- User Experience Designers
- User Interface Designers
- Programmers (Front-End, Back-End, Full-Stack)
- Quality Assurance Engineers

### Tools Used in Software Development:
- Whiteboards for brainstorming
- Online collaboration software
- Project management software
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- Paper and pencil for sketches

### Software Deployment:
Delivering software to intended users.

## Tools of the Trade
### Version Control Systems (VCS):
- Track and manage changes in code
- Benefits include:
  - History of changes
  - Simultaneous work
  - Easier troubleshooting

Most popular VCS: **Git**

### Repository Hosting Services:
- **GitHub** â€“ Stores work in the cloud, provides code reviews, and automates workflows.
- **Bitbucket** â€“ Integrated with Jira, allows task and issue creation in code reviews.

### Libraries vs. Frameworks:
- **Library** â€“ Reusable code that solves common problems.
- **Framework** â€“ A structured environment for building applications.

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
Applications that provide specialized tools for writing, debugging, and compiling code.

Examples:
- **VS Code** (general-purpose)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** (Java)
- **Sublime Text** (lightweight text editor)

# Getting Unstuck:
- Consult **official documentation**
- Check **Stack Overflow**
- Engage with the **developer community**
- Take a short walk to clear your head

# Programming Languages:
Programming languages are used to provide instructions to a computer. They can be categorized by:
- **Syntax (rules)**
- **Semantics (meaning)**

### Source Code:
Human-readable instructions written by programmers, which are later compiled into machine code.

### Variables:
A container for storing values in memory.

### Constants:
Special variables whose values do not change.

### Statements:
Instructions that perform actions, made up of keywords, operators, and expressions.

### Top 5 Programming Languages:
1. Java
2. Python
3. JavaScript
4. C++
5. C#

**Python Example:**
```python
print("Hello world")
score = 750
print(score)
```

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
OOP uses classes and objects to represent real-world things.

**Python Class Example:**
```python
class Puppy():
    def __init__(self, name, favorite_toy):
         self.name = name
         self.favorite_toy = favorite_toy

    def play(self):
        print(self.name + " is playing with " + self.favorite_toy)

marble = Puppy('Marble', 'teddy bear')
marble.play()
```

### Modules:
A file containing Python code, including functions, classes, and variables.

**Advantages of Modules:**
- Simplicity
- Maintainability
- Reusability

**Importing a Module in Python:**
```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(25))
```

# Popular Programming Jobs:
1. **Software Application Developer** â€“ Creates programs for various tasks.
2. **Web Developer** â€“ Builds and maintains websites.
3. **Network Systems Administrator** â€“ Manages company servers, networks, and security.
4. **Mobile Application Developer** â€“ Develops applications for mobile devices.
5. **Software Quality Assurance Engineer (QA)** â€“ Ensures software meets quality standards.

# The Hiring Funnel:
1. Resume Review
2. Recruiter Phone Screening
3. Technical Phone Screening
4. On-Site Interview

# Building Your Tech Portfolio:
- Work on sample projects (e.g., **Recipe App**, **To-Do List**, **Simple Online Game**)
- Contribute to open-source projects (Search GitHub: "help wanted, good for beginners")
- Consider internships
- Maintain a personal blog

# Marketing Yourself:
- Highlight relevant projects
- Show work history
- Document technologies and libraries youâ€™ve used
- Keep resume concise and results-focused

# Technical Interviews:
