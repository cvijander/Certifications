### **To whom it may concern,**  

It is with great pleasure that I recommend **Borko Cvijanović** for the **Junior .NET Developer** position.  

During the program, Borko demonstrated exceptional engagement, dedication, and self-initiative, consistently staying ahead of the curriculum and expanding his knowledge beyond the planned syllabus.  

His work ethic and discipline were outstanding – he completed all assignments on time and frequently submitted additional questions, showcasing his eagerness to learn and improve. He was actively involved in classes, conducted extra research on topics, and generously shared knowledge with his peers. His willingness to collaborate and support his colleagues was commendable.  

Borko stood out not only for his technical skills but also for his ability to tackle challenges. When faced with an obstacle, he never gave up – instead, he devoted time to research, learning, and hands-on practice until he found a solution. This problem-solving mindset and persistence make him a valuable candidate who can quickly adapt to new technologies and industry demands.  

His motivation and passion for programming were evident throughout the entire program. He frequently expressed appreciation for the quality of education and even wished the program lasted longer, further proving his commitment to continuous learning and growth.  

I strongly believe that Borko will be a valuable addition to any team, given his perseverance, initiative, and dedication to improving his skills.
